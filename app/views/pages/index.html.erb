    <h2>Annual Compliance Meeting <%= Time.now.year %> (Life)</h2>
    <p>I have reviewed and understand the compliance rules and regulations noted in the Annual Compliance Meeting presentation, have completed the Annual Compliance Section of the Program, and have reviewed the Representations for Primerica Representatives published with the Workbook on POL. Any representation that I cannot make is noted on the Disclosure and/or Discrepancies form on the back of this page with a brief explanation. â€“ Use the lines at the bottom of the form and/or a separate sheet.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I have new disclosures and/or discrepancies to report that have not been previously reported to Primerica, and I have done so on the <%= Time.now.year %> ACM Disclosure and/or Discrepancies form (located on the back of this page).

    By signing below, I certify that I have personally attended and correctly completed the <%= Time.now.year %> Annual Compliance Meeting, as required by the licenses I hold or the products I sell. My signature makes me accountable for compliance with the law and with Primerica ethics and compliance policies. I will use due diligence to ensure that my business conduct, the conduct of those I supervise, and the business conduct of my associates, is in compliance with the law and with Primerica policy.
    </p>

    <p>
    By signing below, I also certify that I have read and accurately completed the <%= Time.now.year %> ACM Disclosure and/or Discrepancies (if applicable) on the reverse side of this form.
    </p>

    <p>
    I will report any suspected violation of a law, regulation or Primerica compliance standard, and any request made of me to do anything improper or illegal, to my upline RVP, to my OSJA and to appropriate members of the Office of the General Counsel. I have reported any such matters arising in <%= Time.now.year %> to such persons. Any disclosures not previously made to such persons are included in detail on the reverse side on the Disclosures and/or Discrepancies form.
    </p>

    <p>
    I will require of myself, and will expect from my fellow Reps, the highest level of ethical conduct.
